# Bedrock Video Understanding

> This solution is available as a CDK package and can be deployed to your AWS account by running just a few simple scripts.

Understanding video content is inherently complex, as it combines visual, auditory, and temporal information that must be analyzed together for meaningful insights. Different use cases — such as media scene analysis, ad break detection, IP camera tracking, or social media moderation — often require distinct workflows with varying cost, accuracy, and latency trade-offs.

An increasing number of multimodal understanding models and features are now available on Amazon Bedrock.

This video understanding tool allows you to upload videos, experiment with different analysis pipelines and foundation models on Amazon Bedrock, and compare performance across configurations. It streamlines the complex process of extracting reliable metadata from videos and provides an intuitive interface to access the results — either through the UI or programmatically — for further analysis.

## Workflows
This video understanding tool provides three distinct workflows, each leveraging different video extraction methods.

### Frame-based workflow
A traditional approach to video analysis involves sampling image frames at fixed intervals, removing similar or redundant frames, and then applying image understanding foundation models to extract visual information at the frame level. Audio transcription is performed separately. At the end of this workflow, you obtain both visual and audio metadata that can be used for downstream analysis.

### Shot-base workflow
The shot-based workflow follows a similar concept to the frame-based approach, where visual and audio information are extracted independently. However, instead of sampling individual frames, this method segments the video into short clips (shots) or even duration clips and applies video understanding foundation models and video embedding models to each segment.

This approach leverages the flexibility of video understanding models while addressing their limitations with longer videos. By generating both semantic labels and embeddings, it enables more efficient video search and retrieval — balancing accuracy and flexibility for a wide range of use cases.

### Video Embedding
Multimodal embedding is an emerging approach to video understanding, particularly popular for video search. In this tool, we offer two workflows that leverage different video embedding models available on Amazon Bedrock: Nova Multimodal Embedding and TwelveLabs Marengo 2.7 and 3.0. You can upload your videos to these pipelines and perform embedding-based searches using both text and image inputs, enabling efficient semantic video retrieval.

## Token usage and cost estimation
Understanding the cost implications of different video analysis workflows is crucial for optimizing your solution. The Video Understanding Tool provides built-in token usage tracking and cost estimation to help you make informed decisions about model selection and workflow configuration.

For each processed video, the tool generates a detailed cost breakdown by model type. The example below shows a shot-based analysis with shot summaries enabled for each segment. 

> Note that cost estimates cover Amazon Bedrock foundation models and Amazon Transcribe for audio transcription—designed to provide visibility into cost allocation across services. For formal proof-of-concept or production deployments, we recommend conducting a comprehensive cost analysis that includes all AWS services involved.

## Access metadata from the video understanding tool
The tool is designed for video metadata extraction using different pipeline styles. Metadata retrieved from visual and audio analysis, as well as embeddings, are stored in tool-managed AWS resources. You can access this data through multiple methods:

**Amazon S3 storage:**
- **Bucket name:** `bedrock-mm-{account_id}-{region}`
- **Key prefixes by data type:**
  - Uploaded videos: `tasks/{task_id}/upload/`
  - Frame images: `tasks/{task_id}/video_frame_/`
  - Frame analysis outputs: `tasks/{task_id}/frame_outputs/`
  - Shot clips: `tasks/{task_id}/shot_clip/`
  - Shot analysis outputs: `tasks/{task_id}/shot_outputs/`
  - Shot embeddings: `tasks/{task_id}/shot_vector/`
  - Audio transcription: `tasks/{task_id}/transcribe/`
- Raw foundation model outputs stored in JSON or text format
- Complete task metadata for each processed video
- Ideal for archival, audit trails, and accessing unprocessed model responses

**Amazon DynamoDB:**

  - `bedrock_mm_extr_srv_video_task` - Video processing task metadata
  - `bedrock_mm_extr_srv_video_frame` - Frame-level analysis results
  - `bedrock_mm_extr_srv_video_shot` - Shot-level analysis results
  - `bedrock_mm_extr_srv_video_transcript` - Audio transcription data
- **Nova Service table:**
  - `bedrock_mm_nova_video_task` - Nova multimodal embedding tasks
- **TwelveLabs Service table:**
  - `bedrock_mm_tlabs_video_task` - TwelveLabs Marengo embedding tasks
- **Usage tracking:**
  - `bedrock_mm_usage` - Token usage and cost tracking across all services
- Structured data in a standardized, easy-to-process JSON format
- Optimized for querying and filtering by video, timestamp, or analysis type
- Enables efficient retrieval for downstream analytics and applications

**Programmatic API:**
- Invoke processing tasks and retrieve results without using the UI
- Practical for bulk processing, automation, and integration into existing pipelines
- Sample code provided for common access patterns

This flexible access model allows you to integrate the tool into your workflows—whether you're conducting exploratory analysis in notebooks, building automated pipelines, or developing production applications.

## System Architecture
![architecture](./assets/system-architecture.png)

The system is composed of six logical components, each of which can be deployed independently.

<a id="extraction-service"></a>
### 🎬 **Extraction Service**
This subsystem includes two customized workflows: frame-based and shot-based. It is orchestrated using Step Functions and leverages **Amazon Transcribe** for audio transcription.

- The frame-based workflow uses an Amazon Step Functions state machine to orchestrate frame sampling, removal of similar frames, and analysis of each frame using LLM configurations from Bedrock, along with audio transcription via Amazon Transcribe. The resulting task metadata is stored in DynamoDB and on S3, ready for downstream analytics workflows.

![frame-architecture](./assets/frame-based-architecture.png)

- The shot-based workflow follows a similar architecture but with different logic. Videos are segmented either using OpenCV vision-based shot detection or fixed-duration clips. Each clip is analyzed with Bedrock LLMs and video embeddings, and the resulting metadata is stored in DynamoDB and S3 for downstream analytics.

![shot-architecture](./assets/shot-based-architecture.png)

<a id="nova-service"></a>
### 🤖 **Nova Service**
Provides the backend logic for **Nova Multimodal Embedding** with support for embedding-based video search.

<a id="tlabs-service"></a>
### 🧪 **TwelveLabs Service**
Provides the backend logic for **TwelveLabs Marengo 2.7 and 3.0 Embedding** with support for embedding-based video search.

Both of these embedding workflows share a similar architecture, as follows:

![mme-architecture](./assets/mme-architecture.png)


<a id="agent-service"></a>
### 🤖 **Agent Service**
The tool includes an **Agent chatbot** that allows you to consult with an AI assistant for recommendations on the most suitable workflow and configurations for your video. The agent is powered by **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**.

<a id="frontend"></a>
### 🌐 **Frontend Service**
A **React** static website served via **CloudFront** and backed by an **S3** bucket. It provides a user interface to select workflows, upload videos, configure settings, and view extraction results. The site includes real-time token usage and cost estimation displays, embedding-based search capabilities, and a chatbot UI for interacting with the consulting agent.

<a id="analytics-service"></a>
### 📊 **Analytics Service**
The tool handles upstream video analysis, extracting metadata for deeper insights. Sample notebooks demonstrate how to retrieve and use this metadata for common use cases such as IP camera monitoring, movie chapter segmentation, and social media content moderation. You can also extend these samples to build custom analyses tailored to your needs.
